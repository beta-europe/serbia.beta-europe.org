## People behind BETA Serbia

In order to build a stronger European Union, we want for Serbia to be an indispensable and active player in its politics

Our team consists of young, active people whose passion towards the politics of Europe and civic engagement; brought them together to establish this civic association and organize Model European Union Bratislava 2018 as our first project.

We strive to develop effective critical thinking in young people through intercultural dialogue and informal education, and thus contribute to building a stronger European Union based on mutual understanding and educated opinion. Seeing significant, yet unfulfilled potential in Serbia, we work towards encouraging our citizens to play a more active role in national and European affairs, thereby, safeguarding democratic principles which have proven to only benefit Serbia since its introduction.
